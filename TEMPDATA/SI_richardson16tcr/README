Contains code, data, figures.

code:
	Contains richardson16tcr.py, richardson16_module.py
	
	All output data and figures can be generated from the command line by
	navigating to the code directory and then entering:
	$ python richardson16tcr.py
	
	richardson16tcr_module.py contains functions which are called by the
	richardson16tcr.py script to generate these results.
	
	REQUIREMENT: Produced and tested using Python 2.7.6. Designed for 
				 Python 2.6.x or 2.7.x. Module dependencies are listed in
				 richardson16tcr.py. 
				 
				 Python is a free programming language.  Information on how to 
				 download and use scientific Python is available at: 
				 http://www.scipy.org

data:
	Contains all input data along with calculated results. In this version the
	blended and blended-masked temperature series are taken as an input, code
	for blending-masking is ncblendhadcrut.py and ncblendmask.py from Kevin
	Cowtan's paper ( http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015GL064888 ) with a minor
	modification to the masking for the 1pctCO2 simulations as described
	in Supplementary Information Section 6. 
	
	CMIP5 data were taken from the CMIP5 repository accessible via, for example,
	http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/data_getting_started.html . CDO was used
	to perform regridding, stitching together of files or to produce the 
	piControl time series, and is available from: 
	https://code.zmaw.de/projects/cdo 
	
	Further description of CDO and how it is employed in these calculations is
	available in the README for Kevin Cowtan's blending-masking code.
	
	README_data contains more detailed information on each output file.

figures:
	Contains .pdf versions of each figure that is produced by richardson16tcr.py
	through calls to functions in richardson16tcr_module.py
