This README provides more details on the data directory for the supplementary
information of "Reconciling climate response estimates from climate models and
Earthâ€™s energy budget". For general comments, see other README.


Directories are:

1) 1pctCO2			::  1pctCO2 simulations temperature time series
2) forcing			::  Radiative forcing time series
3) hist_rcp85		::  stitched historical-RCP8.5 temperature time series
4) observations		::  observational time series
5) results			::  values reported and tables used in paper
6) TCR				::  calculated TCR values
7) piControl		::  contains time series of CMIP5 preindustrial control 
						simulations

As well as the above directories, the followinf data files are located
directly in the data directory:

					 on HadCRUT4 5x5 degree lat-lon grid
blend-xax-ensmean-5x5.nc - CMIP5 ensemble mean time series for global blended
						   air-water temperature using HadCRUT4 anomaly method
						   on HadCRUT4 5x5 degree lat-lon grid
CRU.nc - gridded time series of HadCRUT4 land temperature anomalies
SST.nc - gridded time series of HadSST3 ocean temperature anomalies

allmodels.txt - time series of forcings for individual models, model is 
				identified by entry in header

6) TCR
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contains folders:
6.1) all			:: TCRs calculated for all models, observations, for each 
					   scenario and method of calculating TCR
6.2) diff_tsens		:: TCRs for different baseline and analysis periods in the 
					   Otto et al. difference calculation applied to models
6.3) tsensitivity	:: Time sensitivity of calculated TCR for each scenario and
					   energy budget method, determined by changing end year
					   of calculation

And file:
IPCC_TCR.txt		:: List of TCRs for CMIP5 models taken from IPCC AR5 WG1
					   Table 9.5.

	----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	6.1) all
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Other than trueTCR.txt, which is the estimate of the canonical TCR, format 
	for filenames is:
	<modelscenario>_<method>.txt
		
	<modelscenario>:
		1pct = 1pctCO2 scenario
		allhist = historical-RCP8.5 scenario, 3 observational datasets and 
				  all models
	
	<method>:
		diffTCR = difference method from Otto et al. In 1pctCO2, baseline of 
				  year 0 and reference period of years 65-74. In historical,
				  baseline of years 1861--1879, reference of 2000--2009.
		oneboxTCR = one-box method from Held et al. In 1pctCO2, start year of 0
					and end year of 70. In historical, start year of 1861 and 	
					end year of 2010. 
		trend TCR = trend method from Bengtsson & Schwartz, start year of 1970
					and end year of 2010.
	
	File format:
		Column1 = name of simulation or observational dataset
		Column2 = TCR calculated using air temperature only
		Column3 = TCR calculated using blended global temperatures
		Column4 = TCR calculated using blended-masked global temperatures with
				  HadCRUT4-based mask

	----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	6.2) diff_tsens
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Format for filenames:
	diffTCR_<baselineperiod>_<referenceperiod>.txt
	
	TCR calculated using difference method applied to observational datasets
	and historical simulations using the labelled periods. File format is the
	same as 6.1)
	
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	6.3) tsensitivity
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Format for filenames:
	histrcp85_<method>_<blending>.txt
	
	<method>:
		diff = difference EBM calculation. Baseline 1861--1880, reference is
			   a decade in each case, with labelled year (top row) being last
			   year of decade.
		onebox = one-box EBM calculation from 1861 until labelled end year.
		trend = trend EBM calculation from 1970 until labelled end year.
	
	<blending>:
		tas = tas-only
		xax = blended
	
	In each file the header shows the end year of the calculation, and other
	rows show calculated TCR for the model run (name in column1) and labelled
	end year.
